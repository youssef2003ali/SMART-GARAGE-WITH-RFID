# SMART-GARAGE-WITH-RFID
The Smart Garage with RFID is an automated parking system designed to enhance security and efficiency using RFID authentication, IR sensors, and a servo motor-controlled gate. The system ensures that only authorized vehicles can enter while maintaining an accurate car count and preventing overcapacity.

Technologies Used:

Microcontroller: ATmega328P (Arduino Uno)
Programming Language: C++ (Arduino framework)
Components: RFID Module (MFRC522), Servo Motor, IR Sensors, Buzzer
Communication Protocols: SPI
Features:

RFID-Based Access Control: Grants entry only to authorized vehicles.
Automated Gate Control: Uses a servo motor to open and close the gate upon successful authentication.
Real-Time Car Count: Keeps track of the number of cars in the garage.
Security Alerts: Triggers a buzzer for unauthorized access attempts or when the garage is full.
Infrared Sensor Integration: Detects vehicle entry and exit to automate gate operation.
This project demonstrates expertise in embedded systems, sensor integration, and real-time automation, making parking management smarter and more efficient.
